                <p>"The Nutcracker" ballet has been a holiday tradition for more than 125 years. Numerous ballet companies around the world stage the famous ballet every December. Both children and adults enjoy the magical performance, for the catchy songs, the dreamy dancing, the elaborate costumes, the fantastical storyline, and the memories that surround the annual tradition.Nuts were historically opened using a hammer and anvil, often made of stone.[1] Some nuts such as walnuts can also be opened by hand, by holding the nut in the palm of the hand and applying pressure with the other palm or thumb, or using another nut.Manufacturers produce modern functional nutcrackers usually somewhat resembling pliers, but with the pivot point at the end beyond the nut, rather than in the middle. These are also used for cracking the shells of crab and lobster to make the meat inside available for eating. </p>
